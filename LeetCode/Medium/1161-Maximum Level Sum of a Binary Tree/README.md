## Problem Link : [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-level-sum-of-a-binary-tree)

## Intuition :
  1. The problem tells to get the level (1 ordered) whuch has max sum .
  2. The intuition is simple traverse the tree get sum of numbers of each level and return that level that has max sum .
  3. Bfs is used in my approach to traverse the tree .

## Complexity :
  Time : O(n)
  Space : O(n)
